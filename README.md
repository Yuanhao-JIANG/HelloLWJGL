# Java_game_engine
This repository is for me to learn to use LWJGL and other supporting technics to develop games using java.  

The main technology include:
  1. LWJGL/lwjgl3 (this includes OpenGL, JOML...)
  2. SpaiR/imgui-java
  3. Google/Gson
  4. ...

JDK: jdk-11.0.9  

VM Option:
  1. firstOpenGLGame: -XstartOnFirstThread -ea -Dimgui.library.path=lib  
  2. learnOpenGL: -XstartOnFirstThread

Note that this engine has not been finished yet, I will keep working on this occasionally if I have time.
